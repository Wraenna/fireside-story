    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>jasper looked around and realized he was alone..</p>
    <p>Though the poor cat thought himself brave, it was quite a different matter when a storm rolled in.</p>
    <p>he then fell into a drain storm running away</p>
    <p>The water was frothy and thick, as though made of particularly rancid maple syrup; he had to resist the urge to lick himself clean.</p>
